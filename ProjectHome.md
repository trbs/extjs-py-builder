A script that lets people using the ExtJS codebase from Subversion create their own packaged builds (concatenated, compressed, etc).

### Versions ###
  * Stable: [build\_ext\_packages.py](http://extjs-py-builder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build_ext_packages.py)
  * Old: [build\_ext\_packages-0.1.py](http://extjs-py-builder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build_ext_packages-0.1.py)

Please use the stable version.

The development version will be under (more or less) constant development, bug free features will be back ported into stable once in a while.

As of the time of writing (2008-02) the Python builder works for the Authors. If you have real problems, needs, issues or patches please feel free to use the Issue tracker or better yet the Extjs Forum thread to report them.
